#### Each Prompt starts with (but can be modified if necessary):
Create a python script that [prompt here]. 
You may use any existing python libraries necessary to write the script. 
Make sure to comment your code, and make sure that it is of a high quality.
Every single program should be runnable using the command python task.py
It should not need any arguments, and if user input is necessary, get it
by asking the user in the script.


## Rerun

1. Look at the ones with '-' at the beginning of the line and not a '='
2. Look for a url in brackets: like [https://www.projectpro.io/article/image-processing-projects-ideas/460]
