ARTHUR:  You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.
       I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
       [pause]
       I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me
       in my Court of Camelot.
       [pause]
       You have proved yourself worthy; will you join me?
       [pause]
       You make me sad.  So be it.  Come, Patsy.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
   ARTHUR:  What?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
   ARTHUR:  I have no quarrel with you, good Sir knight, but I must
       cross this bridge.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Then you shall die.
   ARTHUR:  I command you as King of the Britons to stand aside!
   BLACK KNIGHT:  I move for no man.
   ARTHUR:  So be it!
       [hah]
       [parry thrust]
       [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm off]
   ARTHUR:  Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  'Tis but a scratch.
   ARTHUR:  A scratch?  Your arm's off!
   BLACK KNIGHT:  No, it isn't.
   ARTHUR:  Well, what's that then?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  I've had worse.
   ARTHUR:  You liar!
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on you pansy!
       [hah]
       [parry thrust]
       [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's right arm off]
   ARTHUR:  Victory is mine!
       [kneeling]
       We thank thee Lord, that in thy merc-
       [hah]
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on then.
   ARTHUR:  What?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Have at you!
   ARTHUR:  You are indeed brave, Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, had enough, eh?
   ARTHUR:  Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Yes I have.
   ARTHUR:  Look!
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Just a flesh wound.
       [bang]
   ARTHUR:  Look, stop that.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Chicken!  Chicken!
   ARTHUR:  Look, I'll have your leg.  Right!
       [whop]
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Right, I'll do you for that!
   ARTHUR:  You'll what?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Come 'ere!
   ARTHUR:  What are you going to do, bleed on me?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  I'm invincible!
   ARTHUR:  You're a loony.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  The Black Knight always triumphs!
       Have at you!  Come on then.
       [whop]
       [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's other leg off]
   BLACK KNIGHT:  All right; we'll call it a draw.
   ARTHUR:  Come, Patsy.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, oh, I see, running away then.  You yellow
       bastards!  Come back here and take what's coming to you.
       I'll bite your legs off!
 

Scene 5

 
   CROWD:  A witch!  A witch!  A witch!  We've got a witch!  A witch!
   VILLAGER #1:  We have found a witch, might we burn her?
   CROWD:  Burn her!  Burn!
   BEDEMIR:  How do you know she is a witch?
   VILLAGER #2:  She looks like one.
   BEDEMIR:  Bring her forward.
   WITCH:  I'm not a witch.  I'm not a witch.
   BEDEMIR:  But you are dressed as one.
   WITCH:  They dressed me up like this.
   CROWD:  No, we didn't... no.
   WITCH:  And this isn't my nose, it's a false one.
   BEDEMIR:  Well?
   VILLAGER #1:  Well, we did do the nose.
   BEDEMIR:  The nose?
   VILLAGER #1:  And the hat -- but she is a witch!
   CROWD:  Burn her!  Witch!  Witch!  Burn her!
   BEDEMIR:  Did you dress her up like this?
   CROWD:  No, no... no ... yes.  Yes, yes, a bit, a bit.
   VILLAGER #1:  She has got a wart.
   BEDEMIR:  What makes you think she is a witch?
   VILLAGER #3:  Well, she turned me into a newt.
   BEDEMIR:  A newt?
   VILLAGER #3:  I got better.
   VILLAGER #2:  Burn her anyway!
   CROWD:  Burn!  Burn her!
   BEDEMIR:  Quiet, quiet.  Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether
       she is a witch.
   CROWD:  Are there?  What are they?
   BEDEMIR:  Tell me, what do you do with witches?
   VILLAGER #2:  Burn!
   CROWD:  Burn, burn them up!
   BEDEMIR:  And what do you burn apart from witches?
   VILLAGER #1:  More witches!
   VILLAGER #2:  Wood!
   BEDEMIR:  So, why do witches burn?
       [pause]
   VILLAGER #3:  B--... 'cause they're made of wood...?
   BEDEMIR:  Good!
   CROWD:  Oh yeah, yeah...
   BEDEMIR:  So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
   VILLAGER #1:  Build a bridge out of her.
   BEDEMIR:  Aah, but can you not also build bridges out of stone?
   VILLAGER #2:  Oh, yeah.
   BEDEMIR:  Does wood sink in water?
   VILLAGER #1:  No, no.
   VILLAGER #2:  It floats!  It floats!
   VILLAGER #1:  Throw her into the pond!
   CROWD:  The pond!
   BEDEMIR:  What also floats in water?
   VILLAGER #1:  Bread!
   VILLAGER #2:  Apples!
   VILLAGER #3:  Very small rocks!
   VILLAGER #1:  Cider!
