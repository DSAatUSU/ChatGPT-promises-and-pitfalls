displays-a-discrete-graph-needs-a-representation-and-possib.py,data-analysis,data-visualizations,less,2,12,1,2,6,It might not have understood what I meant by a discrete graph (although it did understand in other situations)
creates-a-plot-to-get-a-general-statistics-of-iris-data.py,data-analysis,iris-flower-dataset-problems,less,1,18,1,1,6,"Interpreter error, seems that the program didn't like the dataset, it says ""Objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape"""
recursively-deletes-every-node-in-an-arbitrarily-long-linked.py,algorithms-data-structures,recursion,less,6,31,2,4,6,doesn't actually delete the nodes apparently?
generates-a-binary-search-tree-and-prints-a-top-view-of-it-i.py,algorithms-data-structures,general,less,12,54,8,11,13,"It uses a queue to display only some of the values of the nodes, which is strange, although I did ask it to give a ""top"" view of it, which it might not understand"
generates-a-binary-search-tree-and-performs-a-postorder-trav.py,algorithms-data-structures,general,less,2,13,2,6,7,Needs binarytree module. It was extremely easy to fix. It use the wrong function to generate the random tree. Change build to bst
uses-the-python-turtle-module-to-draw-the-letters-gpt-usin.py,visual-graphical-drawing,drawing-common-objects,less,2,42,2,3,1,It obviously doesn't have a notion of what letters look like
uses-at-least-one-for-loop-and-one-while-loop-to-create.py,visual-graphical-drawing,drawing-common-objects,less,3,17,0,0,6,"while it did the assignment correctly, it did not use a while loop to complete it. It makes me wonder if gpt doesn't understand having the structure of the code dictated"
prints-pascals-triangle-to-n-rows.py,visual-graphical-drawing,drawing-common-objects,less,7,12,4,9,3,"In my experience, GPT never gets centering right"
accepts-a-stl-file-and-displays-its-contents.py,visual-graphical-drawing,image-processing,less,2,16,2,3,10,It failed and I don't know how to debug it
creates-a-user-interface-for-a-calculator-it-does-not-need.py,visual-graphical-drawing,gui,less,2,11,0,0,5,"I think it misunderstood what I meant, but there was no buttons or anything like that"
creates-a-ui-that-is-a-basic-desktop-program-with-a-title-ba.py,visual-graphical-drawing,gui,less,1,1,0,0,1,"NOTE: This one is an outlier, a bad datapiont. It flat out refused to generate the code. Must have been to complex of a prompt"
generates-a-collage-from-pictures-on-the-internet-after-bein.py,visual-graphical-drawing,image-generation,less,3,34,2,5,18,"Old library, seems as though it no longer works: Here is the version that I used: https://github.com/Joeclinton1/google-images-download"
is-a-calculator-that-gets-the-rref-of-a-matrix.py,mathematics,linear-algebra,less,7,30,5,13,0,"Dont know why, but it doesn't even report the correct number of rows and columns for the matrix. Need to do more on this one"
deterimes-if-a-small-randomly-generated-graph-is-hamiltonia.py,mathematics,discrete-graphs,less,2,14,4,7,8,"Interesting, it used the library incorrectly. It's important to note that this is an np-complete problem, which is why the library has no implementation for it."
is-is-calculator-that-will-return-the-equation-for-a-tangent.py,mathematics,calculus-calculators,less,2,15,3,10,7,It seems as though it is trying to differentiate a scalar. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable in sympy could understand what is going on.
